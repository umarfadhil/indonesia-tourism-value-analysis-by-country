# Indonesia's Tourism Value Analysis: Who Brings the Largest Economic Value?

## 📌 Project Overview
Since the first year of President Prabowo’s administration, Indonesia has implemented major budget efficiency measures across ministries. In 2025, the Ministry of Tourism experienced a **~40% budget reduction**, pushing policymakers and tourism stakeholders to rethink how tourism promotion resources are allocated.

Rather than focusing solely on **visitor volume**, this project shifts the lens to **economic value generated by tourists from different countries**. The core idea is simple: *more visitors do not always mean more value*.

This repository documents an end‑to‑end **data analysis and supervised learning project** using the **CRISP‑DM framework**, aimed at supporting more **targeted, value‑driven tourism strategies**.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions
This project addresses two main questions:
1. **Which countries generate the highest tourism economic value for Indonesia?**
2. **What factors explain why some countries contribute higher tourism value than others?**

---

## 💡 Business Value
Insights from this analysis can be leveraged by:
- ✅ **Government** → designing targeted and cost‑effective tourism policies
- ✅ **Airlines** → strengthening and prioritising profitable international routes
- ✅ **Tourism stakeholders** → adjusting services (language support, habits, spending patterns)

---

## 🧭 Analytical Framework
- **Framework**: CRISP‑DM (Business Understanding → Deployment)
- **Unit of analysis**: Country × Year
- **Approach**: Descriptive analytics & Supervised learning (Regression)
- **Goal**: Interpretability + predictive insight

---

## 🗂️ Data Overview
The dataset consists of international tourism indicators aggregated by **country and year**, including:
- Total tourism value
- Number of visits
- Average spending per day
- Average length of stay (ALOS)

All variables are cleaned, transformed, and validated prior to modelling.

---

## 🤖 Models Used
To balance interpretability and performance, multiple regression models are evaluated:
- Linear Regression (baseline & interpretability)
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

Model comparison focuses on **explanatory power**, **stability**, and **policy relevance**—not just accuracy.

---

## 📊 Key Outputs
- Ranking of countries by **total tourism economic value**
- Identification of **key drivers** of tourism value
- Comparison between **high‑volume vs high‑value** tourist origins
- Visualisations and tables ready for stakeholder communication
